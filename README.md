# hey, i'm [wyli](https://web.wyli.tech)

That's a psuedonym, you probably don't know me.

What I enjoy: 
- CTF's (especially reverse engineering and pwn)
- Competitive programming (slowly getting better at it)
- Research
- Eletrical engineering (though I have nowhere near enough time lol)
- Doom emacs (keeps myself organized)

~~I daily drive void linux~~ (no longer, I switched back to arch)
